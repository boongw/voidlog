/**
 * Boss-ability casts synthesized as MechanicEvent rows independent of
 * whether any player actually got hit. EI's `mechanics[]` only records
 * *hits* (e.g. "Jaws.H" for Primordus's Jaws of Destruction) — a cast the
 * whole group dodged never appears there, so a "when does this attack
 * happen" timeline marker built from `mechanics[]` alone silently misses
 * casts (confirmed on a real Harvest Temple CM log: 2 actual Jaws casts,
 * only 1 corresponding "Jaws.H" hit).
 *
 * `targets[].rotation` (EI's per-target cast log, keyed by skill id) has
 * every cast regardless of outcome — that's the source here.
 *
 * Targets are matched by `EiTarget.id` (a stable per-species id), NOT by
 * `name` — `name` is localized to the recording client's game-client
 * language. Confirmed on two real logs: a German-client recording names
 * the giants "Riese der Leere 1/2/3" and the Time Caster "Zeitzauberer der
 * Leere"; an English-client recording of the same encounter names them
 * "Void Giant 1/2/3" and "Void Time Caster" — both share the same `id`s
 * (24450 for all three giants, 25025 for the Time Caster). Matching by
 * name alone would silently drop all cast data for non-German clients.
 *
 * Two layers:
 * - `CURATED_CAST_MARKERS_BY_BOSS`: individually named/relevant attacks,
 *   shown as distinct timeline ticks in the UI (see batch-attempts.tsx).
 * - `CAST_TARGET_GROUPS_BY_BOSS`: every *other* rotation skill for these
 *   targets is captured too (generic "<group>.Cast.<skillId>" name, skill
 *   name from `skillMap`), so the data already exists for later analysis
 *   even before it's individually curated. Not surfaced in the UI yet
 *   (see `isNoiseMechanic` on the web side).
 *
 * Known gap: Soo-Won CM's "Void Obliterator"/"Void Goliath" adds aren't
 * covered yet — no sample log reaching that deep into the encounter was
 * available to confirm their target ids.

 *
 * This exists because the more obvious source — `EiTarget.firstAware` on

 * a real log: Primordus's Greens fired 4 times total (raw S.Green/F.Green
 * timestamps ~40-55s apart), reusing the same 3 actors instead of creating
 * new ones each time, so `firstAware` only ever produced 1-2 markers total
 * — most occurrences were silently missing from the timeline. The
 * S.Green/F.Green mechanic itself fires every time (that's what resolves
 * each stack attempt pass/fail), so clustering *those* timestamps instead
 * captures every occurrence. `clusterGapMs` just needs to be comfortably
 * between "actors resolving the same wave" (observed ~0-2ms apart) and
 * "distinct waves" (observed 40s+ apart) — not tied to real spawn/resolve
